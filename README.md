This is a collection of leetcode solutions in java.

Many thanks to Fangqin Dai(https://github.com/soulmachine/leetcode) and all who share their brilliant ideas.

For those who are in job seeking, preparing job interviews or just interested in algorithms, some possible solutions of LeetCode Online Judge (LCOJ) are provided in this repository.These codes are free to everyone. Ideas and advices are very welcome.

The code sequence does not exactly match that of LCOJ. It is just a sequence which may be suitable for the beginners in the domain of algorithms.

To pass LCOJ, these codes may have to be modified accordingly, yet they are applicable for most common java development environment.

Thanks again for all who contribute to the open-source community.
